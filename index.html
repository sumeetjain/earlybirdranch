	<p>Early Bird Ranch in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Pescadero,+CA&sll=37.762585,-122.433313&sspn=0.010789,0.014591&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Pescadero,+California&z=14" title="View Map" target="_blank">Pescadero</a> is excited to announce we are now taking pre-orders on our pasture-raised broiler chickens and turkeys.</p>
	<p>Once out on pasture, our birds live in low density populations and are protected from predators by 8 foot by 8 foot mobile pasture shelters that are moved every day at sunrise and mid-afternoon. This method ensures the chickens have twice-daily access to fresh and undisturbed pasture and means that their diet has a higher proportion of forage and bugs than free-ranging alone provides.</p>
	<p>We supplement their access to pasture with feed that is free of antibiotics and hormones. We source our feed and chicks from California's Central Valley, and are constantly striving to provide a product that is as local, nutrient-dense, and affordable as possible.</p>
	<p>We have sold out our September 11 pick-up date for our pasture-raised broilers, but we still have chickens available for our second processing day on Saturday, September 18 from 1:00p-6:00p. We will be processing the chickens in the morning and ready to take payment and bag the birds between 1pm and 6pm, but please feel free to come out early to see the farm, ask questions, take a walk, visit the town of Pescadero, or meet the turkeys and next batch of chickens.</p>
	<p>When you arrive the birds will be ready to take home (just like you'd buy in a store) and chilling in ice baths.  We will be more than happy to bag them fresh for you. They will be nice and cold when you pick them up, however because we do not sell frozen birds, we strongly recommend you bring a cooler with some ice to get them home in. We will send along with your pre-order a document with what to bring and all the details.</p>
	<p>Please email us to learn more about the farm and to place your pre-order today for this batch of Early Bird Broilers and November's batch of Early Bird Turkeys. Our broilers will likely average around 4 pounds in weight (after processing).  They are $3.95 per pound and require a $5 deposit that will be deducted from the final sale price. Our turkeys should average 12-18 pounds in weight and are also $3.95 per pound, but require a $25 deposit that is also deducted from the final sale price.</p>
	<p>Gratefully,<br />
	<em>Kevin and ShaeLynn</em><br />
