	<p>Early Bird Ranch in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Pescadero,+CA&sll=37.762585,-122.433313&sspn=0.010789,0.014591&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Pescadero,+California&z=14" title="View Map" target="_blank">Pescadero</a> is now taking pre-orders on our pasture-raised broiler chickens and turkeys.</p>

	<p><a rel="lightbox" href="images/pastures.png"><img class="left" src="images/pastures.png" alt="Pastures" /></a> Once out on pasture, our chickens live in low density populations and are protected from predators by 8 foot by 8 foot mobile pasture shelters that are moved every day at sunrise and mid-afternoon. This method ensures the chickens have twice-daily access to fresh and undisturbed pasture and means that their diet has a higher proportion of forage and bugs than free-ranging alone provides.</p>

	<p>We supplement their access to pasture with feed that is free of antibiotics and hormones. We source our feed and chicks from California's Central Valley, and we are constantly striving to provide a product that is as local, nutrient-dense, and affordable as possible.</p>

	<p>We have three fresh pick-up days planned for Batch 2: <strong>Wednesday, October 27 from 3:30p-6:30p &mdash; Saturday, October 30 from 3:30p-6:30p &mdash; and Sunday, October from 3:30p-6:30p</strong>. We will be processing the chickens in the morning and ready to take payment at the listed times.  Please feel free to come out early to see the farm, ask questions, take a walk, visit the town of Pescadero, or meet the Thanksgiving turkeys and next batch of chickens.</p>

	<p>If you are interested in ordering a Thanksgiving turkey, we still have some available.  They will be ready for pickup on November 13, 21, and 23.</p>

	<p>When you arrive the birds will be ready to take home (just like you'd buy in a store) and chilling in ice baths. We will be more than happy to bag them fresh for you. They will be nice and cold when you pick them up, but we strongly recommend you bring a cooler with some ice to get them home in. We will send along with your pre-order a document with what to bring and all the details.</p>

	<p>If you’d prefer to buy a frozen bird, they are occasionally available for pick-up on the farm by appointment—contact us to find out if we have any in stock now.</p>

	<p><a rel="lightbox" href="images/farmers2.jpg"><img class="right" src="images/farmers2.jpg" alt="Kevin and ShaeLynn" /></a> Please email us to learn more about the farm and to place your pre-order today for this new batch of Early Bird Broilers and November's batch of Thanksgiving Early Bird Turkeys. Our broilers will likely average around 4 pounds in weight (after processing). They are $3.95 per pound and require a $5 deposit that will be deducted from the final sale price. Our turkeys should average 14-20 pounds in weight and are also $3.95 per pound, but require a $25 deposit that is also deducted from the final sale price.</p>

	<p>Gratefully,<br />
	<em>Kevin and ShaeLynn</em><br />
